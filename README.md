# Welcome to rykarn's css crime workshop repo

This is a complete mess of a repo consisting of a bunch of python scripts for generating html that could be copy pasted into cohost, as well as some common functions for making the process easier.

My workflow was something like this:

- Copy the `template.py` file to a new file.
- Execute the python script in vscode to generate `post.html`
- Use the Live Server vscode extension to get an autoupdating view of what the html appears as in the browser
- Copy the contents of the `<body>` tag of `post.html` and paste into the cohost post composer

No effort was spent on the maintainability of the code. A bunch of older generating scripts might have been broken by later changes to the common library functions I made. I'm not sure. As mentioned earlier, this repo is a mess.

You can the resulting css crimes on [my cohost page](https://cohost.org/rykarn/tagged/css%20crimes).

Farewell Cohost.
