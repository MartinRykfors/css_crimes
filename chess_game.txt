E: Let's play chess! Your move!

[the chess board is in front of you. the white king's pawn is highligted]
Y: *clicks the highlighted pawn

[the pawn moves to e4]

E (surprised): Ooooh, the semi-argentinian opening! You must be a pro!

E: Ok, my turn.

E: I play Eggbug's blessing, giving me +3 actions!

[A card hovers above the board allowing you to read it. The card moves down to the side]

Y: I don't remember there being cards in Chess?

E: I move my knight to f6!

E: Second action, I equip my knight with a Railgun!

[A card hovers above the board allowing you to read it. It shows a q3 railgun. The card moves down to the side]

Y: What!? Railguns?

E: Final action, fire railgun! Roll for accuracy!

[A d20 is rolled, eventually stopping showing a 20]

[The knight begins glowing, then quickly emits a beam at your king. The entire board shakes.]

[Your king is gone, only a scorch mark remains]

E: *pauses

E (joyful): Checkmate! I win!

Y: Eggbug. This variant of chess does not seem fair. I don't even have any cards.

E: Oh? Ok, have a booster pack, on the house!

[A booster pack appears]

[You click it]

[The booster pack is replaced with a card]

Card: Dowsing rod. Turn a random square occupied by a friendly piece into a water tile.

E: Let's play again!

Y: Um, this card does not seem very good, but whatever. I'll give it a try.

Y: *Plays Dowsing rod

[Your king tile turns blue.]

[Your king vanishes].

E: Hm. You drowned your king.

E: *Pauses

E: I win!

Y: I'm not sure I like this chess variant, Eggbug.

E: Practice makes perfect!

Y: Seems more like booster packs make perfect.
